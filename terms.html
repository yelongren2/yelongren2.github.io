          <div class="text-align-mq">
            <strong>Effective April, 2022.</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Menten strives to provide a disruptive social communication platform in an effort to
              connect local communities. As a member of your local community, it is your
              responsibility to uphold good morals as you communicate with other members in your
              community.</strong><br><br>
            <p class="p-light">The Menten Terms of Service (“Terms”) applies to your access to use our communication
              application, thereafter referred to as (“Services”), provided by Menten, thereafter referred to as (“Menten”, “we”, or “us”).</p>
            <p class="p-light">Menten is designed to provide a safe and fun environment to communicate with your physical
              neighbors, please keep this in mind when communicating with fellow
              users of Menten. Do not say anything that you would not say without the masquerade of a
              screen and keyboard. By accessing our services you hereby agree to become bound by the
              terms and conditions set forth. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access our
              Services.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>1. Your Access to the Services</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="p-light">Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise use the
              Services. Additionally, if you are in the European Economic Area, you must be over the age
              required by the laws of your country to create an account or otherwise use the Services, or we
              need to have received verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian.</p>
            <p class="p-light">In addition, certain Services or portions of our Services require you to be older than 13 years of
              age, so please read all notices and any Additional Terms carefully when you access the
              Services.</p>
            <p class="p-light">If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of another legal entity, including a business or a
              government, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind such entity to these terms.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h4>2. Your Use of the Services</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="p-light">Menten grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to
              use and access the Services solely as permitted by these Terms. We reserve all rights not
              expressly granted to you by these Terms.</p>
            <p class="p-light">Except as permitted through the Services or as otherwise permitted by us in writing, your license
              does not include the right to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="li-light">license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the
                Services or Content;</li>
              <li class="li-light">modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any
                part of the Services or Content; or</li>
              <li class="li-light">access the Services or Content in order to build a similar or competitive website,
                product, or service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-light">We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or in part) at any
              time, with or without notice to you. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality
              of the Services will be subject to these Terms, which may be updated from time to time. You
              agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or
              discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>3. Your Account Security</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="p-light">To use the Services you are required to create a Menten account (an "Account") and provide
              us with a phone number and certain other information about yourself as set forth in the
              Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p class="p-light">You are solely responsible for the information associated with Your Account and anything that
              happens related to Your Account. You must maintain the security of your Account and promptly
              notify Menten if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without
              your permission.</p>
            <p class="p-light">You will not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior written approval.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>4. Your Content</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="p-light">The Services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, or other materials
              (“Content”), including Content created with or submitted to the Services by you or through your
              Account (“Your Content”). We take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly
              endorse any of Your Content.</p>
            <p class="p-light">By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights,
              power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these
              Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to
              liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights.</p>
            <p class="p-light">You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Menten the following
              license to use that Content:</p>
            <p class="p-light">When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide,
              royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to
              use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display Your
              Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content
              in all media formats and channels now known or later developed. This license includes the right
              for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by
              other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Menten. You also agree that
              we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims
              and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.</p>
            <p class="p-light">Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Menten or our Services that you provide to us
              are entirely voluntary, and you agree that Menten may use such ideas, suggestions, and
              feedback without compensation or obligation to you.</p>
            <p class="p-light">Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole
              discretion, delete or remove Your Content at any time and for any reason, including for a
              violation of these Terms, a violation of our Content Policy, or if you otherwise create liability for
              us or our partners.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>5. Third-Party Content, Advertisements and Promotions</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="p-light">The Services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services, which may be
              posted by advertisers, our affiliates, our partners, or other users (“Third-Party Content”).
              Third-Party Content is not under our control, and we are not responsible for any of their
              websites, applications, products, or services. Your use of Third-Party Content is at your own risk
              and you should make any investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any
              transaction in connection with such Third-Party Content.</p>
            <p class="p-light">The Services may also contain sponsored Third-Party Content or advertisements. The type,
              degree, and targeting of advertisements are subject to change, and you acknowledge and agree
              that we may place advertisements in connection with the display of any Content or information
              on the Services, including Your Content.</p>
            <p class="p-light">If you choose to use the Services to conduct a promotion, including a contest or sweepstakes,
              you alone are responsible for conducting the promotion in compliance with all applicable laws
              and regulations. The terms of your promotion must specifically state that the promotion is not
              sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with Menten and the rules for your promotion must
              require each entrant or participant to release Menten from any liability related to the
              promotion.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>6. Things You Cannot Do</h4>

              Services. We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a security

              licensors, our third party service providers and our officers, employees, licensors, and agents
              (the “Menten Entities”) harmless, including costs and attorneys’ fees, from any claim or
              demand made by any third party due to or arising out of (a) your use of the Services, (b) your

            <p class="p-light">IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT,
              NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE, WILL THE MENTEN
              ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY,
              INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS ARISING FROM OR
              RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES, INCLUDING THOSE ARISING FROM
              OR RELATING TO CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE ON THE SERVICES THAT IS ALLEGED TO
              BE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL. ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SERVICES
              IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
              FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR DEVICE OR COMPUTER SYSTEM, OR LOSS OF DATA
              RESULTING THEREFROM. IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE
              MENTEN ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100)
              OR ANY AMOUNT YOU PAID MENTEN IN THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS FOR THE
              SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL
              APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING THOSE BASED ON WARRANTY,
              CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND EVEN IF
              THE MENTEN ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH
              DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF ANY REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED
              ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO
              THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.</p>
<!--             <br>
            <h4>11. Governing Law and Venue</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="p-light">We want you to enjoy Menten, so if you have an issue or dispute, you agree to raise it and try
              to resolve it with us informally. You can contact us with feedback and concerns here or by
              emailing us at <a href="mailto:contact@menten.app" target="_blank">contact@menten.app</a>.</p>
            <p class="p-light">Except for the government entities listed below: any claims arising out of or relating to these
              Terms or the Services will be governed by the laws of Texas, other than its conflict of laws rules;
              all disputes related to these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state
              courts located in Montgomery County, Texas; and you consent to personal jurisdiction in these
              courts.</p>
            <strong>Government Entities</strong><br><br>
            <p class="p-light">If you are a U.S. city, county, or state government entity, then this Section 13 does not apply to

              to conflict of laws. To the extent permitted by federal law, the laws of Texas (other than its
              conflict of law rules) will apply in the absence of applicable federal law. All disputes related to
              these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in
              Montgomery County, Texas.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="p-light">We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the
              amended Terms to our Services and update the Effective Date above. If the changes, in our
              sole discretion, are material, we may also notify you by
              providing notice through our Services. By continuing to access or use the Services on or after
              the Effective Date of the revised Terms, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do
              not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop accessing and using our Services before the
              changes become effective.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>12. Additional Terms</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="p-light">Because we offer a variety of Services, you may be asked to agree to additional terms before
              using a specific product or service offered by Menten (“Additional Terms”). To the extent any
              Additional Terms conflict with these Terms, the Additional Terms govern with respect to your
              use of the corresponding Service.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>13. Termination</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="p-light">You may terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your Account and
