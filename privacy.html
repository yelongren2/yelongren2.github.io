            <strong>Effective March, 2022.</strong><br><br>
            <p class="p-light">We want you to understand how and why Menten (“Menten,” “we” or
              “us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our sites, mobile apps, widgets,
              and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact
              with us or receive a communication from us. This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>What We Collect (and How it is Used and Shared)</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="p-underline">Information You Provide to Us</p>
            <p class="p-light">We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Account information</li>
              <p class="p-light">When you create a Menten account, we require you to provide a
                phone number and username. Your username is public, and it doesn’t have to
                be related to your real name. You may also provide other account
                information, like a profile picture. We also store your user account
                preferences and settings.</p>
              <li>Content you submit</li>
              <p class="p-light">We collect the content you submit to the Services. This includes your chats
                and messages, and other communications with us. Your content may
                include text, links, images, gifs.</p>
              <li>Actions you take</li>
              <p class="p-light">We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services.
                This includes your interactions with content. It also includes your
                interactions with other users, such as blocking.</p>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-underline">Information We Collect Automatically</p>
            <p class="p-light">When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about
              you. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Log and usage data</li>
              <p class="p-light">We may log information when you access and use the Services. This may
                include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system,
                referral URLs, device information (e.g., device models), device settings, pages
                visited, links clicked, the requested URL, and search terms.</p>
              <li>Location information</li>
              <p class="p-light">We receive and process information about your location. For example, with
                your consent, we collect information about the specific location of your
                mobile device (for example, by using GPS or Bluetooth). We may also
                receive location information from you when you choose to share such
                information on our Services, including by associating your content with a
                location, or we may derive your approximate location from other information
                about you, including your IP address.</p>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-underline">We use information about you to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="li-light">Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;</li>
              <li class="li-light">Research and develop new services;</li>
              <li class="li-light">Help protect the safety of Menten and our users, which includes blocking suspected
                spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Menten User Agreement and our other
                policies;</li>
              <li class="li-light">Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices, and other support and
                administrative messages;</li>
              <li class="li-light">Provide customer service;</li>
              <li class="li-light">Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide
                other news and information we think will be of interest to you;</li>
              <li class="li-light">Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services;</li>
              <li class="li-light">Measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services; and</li>
              <li class="li-light">Personalize the Services, and provide and optimize advertisements, content, and features
                that match user profiles or interests.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-light">Much of the information on the Services is private and accessible only to registered Menten users. By using the Services, you are directing us to share this information privately and freely.</p>
            <p class="p-light">When you submit content (including a profile photo, or chat message) to the
              Services, any registered users of our Services, that you have chosen to share that content with, will be able to see that content, the username
              associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content. Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become
              public and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services.</p>
            <p class="p-light">Your Menten account has profile photos that are visible to Menten users only if you so choose. Your profile photos contain information about how they were taken, such as timestamp and device used.</p>
<!--             <p class="p-light">We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with
              other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends
              or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social
              sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and
              processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third
              parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>).</p>
 -->            
              <p class="p-light">Menten only shares non-public information about you in the following ways. We do not sell this
              information.</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="li-light"><i>With your consent. </i>We may share information about you with your consent or at your
                direction.</li>
<!--               <li class="li-light"><i>With linked services. </i>If you link your Menten account with a third-party service, Menten
                will share the information you authorize with that third-party service. You can control this
                sharing as described in "Your Choices" below.</li>
 -->                
              <li class="li-light"><i>With our service providers. </i>We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other
                service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us. Their use of
                personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures. A few
                examples: (i) payment processors who process transactions on our behalf, (ii) cloud
                providers who host our data and our services, (iii) third-party ads measurement providers
                who help us and advertisers measure the performance of ads shown on our Services.</li>
              <li class="li-light"><i>To comply with the law. </i>We may share information in response to a request for information if
                we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation,
                legal process, or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national
                security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to
                provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a
                request.</li>
              <li class="li-light"><i>In an emergency. </i>We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent
                and serious bodily harm to a person.</li>
              <li class="li-light"><i>To enforce our policies and rights. </i>We may share information if we believe your actions are
                inconsistent with our User Agreement, or other Menten policies, or to protect the rights,
                property, and safety of ourselves and others.</li>
              <li class="li-light"><i>With our affiliates. </i>We may share information between and among Menten, and any of our
                parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.</li>
              <li class="li-light"><i>Aggregated or de-identified information. </i>We may share information about you that has been
                aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>How We Protect Your Information</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="p-light">We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized
              access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS while information is
              being transmitted. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our
              employees have access to non-public personal information.</p>
<!--             <p class="p-light">You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication.</p>
 -->            
            <p class="p-light">We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we
              originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as
              required by law.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Your Rights</h4>
            <br>
            <strong>Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests</strong>
            <br><br>
            <p class="p-light">Requests for a copy of the information Menten has about your account—including EU General
              Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) data subject access requests and California Consumer Privacy
              Act (CCPA) consumer information requests.</p>
            <p class="p-light">All other data subject and consumer requests under data protection laws should be sent via email to
              <a href="mailto:contact@menten.app" target="_blank">contact@menten.app</a> with the phone number that you have verified with your
              Menten account in the Subject email field.</p>
            <p class="p-light">Before we process a request from you about your personal information, we need to verify the
              request via your access to your Menten account or to a verified phone number associated with your
              Menten account. You may also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your
              behalf. Menten does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection
              laws to make requests regarding their personal information.</p>
            <strong>Additional Information for California Users</strong>
            <br><br>
            <p class="p-light">The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide California residents with some
              additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we
              get that personal information, and how and why we use it.</p>
            <p class="p-light">In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from California
              residents, depending on the Services used:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="li-light">Identifiers, like your Menten username, phone number, and gender.</li>
<!--               <li class="li-light">Commercial information, including information about transactions you undertake with us.</li>
 -->              
              <li class="li-light">Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as information about your
                activity on our Services and limited information about your activity on the services of
                advertisers who use our advertising technology.</li>
              <li class="li-light">Geolocation information based on your IP address, or more specific location information if
                you authorize your device to provide it to us.</li>
              <li class="li-light">Audiovisual information in pictures, audio, or video content submitted to Menten.</li>
<!--               <li class="li-light">Professional or employment-related information or demographic information, but only if you
                explicitly provide it to us, such as by applying for a job or filling out a survey.</li>
 -->              
                <li class="li-light">Inferences we make based on other collected data, for purposes such as recommending
                content, advertising, and analytics.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-light">You can find more information about (a) what we collect and sources of that information, (b) the
              business and commercial purposes for collecting that information, and (c) the categories of third
              parties with whom we share that information in the “What We Collect (and How it is Used and
              Shared)” section above.</p>
            <p class="p-light">If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, including the right to
              request access to or deletion of your personal information, and information about our data practices,
              as well as the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your privacy rights. These rights
              can be exercised as described in the Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests section
              above.</p>
            <strong>Children</strong>
            <br><br>
            <p class="p-light">Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise use the Services.
              Additionally, if you are in the EEA, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country to
              create an account or otherwise use the Services, or we need to have obtained verifiable consent
              from your parent or legal guardian.</p>
            <strong>Changes to This Policy</strong>
            <br><br>
            <p class="p-light">We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will let you know by revising the
              date at the top of the policy. If the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may also notify
              you by providing notice through our Services. We encourage you to
              review the Privacy Policy whenever you access or use our Services or otherwise interact with us to
              stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. By
              continuing to use our Services after Privacy Policy changes go into effect, you agree to be bound by
              the revised policy.</p>
